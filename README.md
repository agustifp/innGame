Frontend: 

Develop a panel  where user can see the evolution of the construction and the amount of resources. 
You can add things like Header, menu, footer or wherever you like :)

Ending:

In Innroute we are a little lazy and we like automatizing things. 
To conquer us, you need to create 10 powerful trucks in one click. When user execute the code, it  have to start running until Mission complete or until when you want.

HINT: Trailer hub level 5 equals 11 Trailers capacity.

Happy Coding!
